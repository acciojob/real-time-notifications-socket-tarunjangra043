# Real Time Notifications Socket

Build a real-time notification system for a web application. Implement a function that subscribes to a `WebSocket server` and processes `incoming notifications`. The function should also gracefully handle scenarios such as server `disconnections` and `reconnections`.

## Instructions

1. Basic Boilerplate is given to you, just implement JS.
2. When `connected` to websocket server customer should be able to `send messages`
3. When `disconnected` to server you shouldnâ€™t be able to send any message
4. After disconnect `reconnect` to websocket server automatically after `10 seconds`
